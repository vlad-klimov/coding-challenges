### 24metrics.io coding challenges collection

The 24metrics.io coding challenge is an opportunity to demonstrate proficiency with problem solving, collaboration skills, and curiosity we would expect you to demonstrate at 24metrics.

### Your Challenge README

Include the following in your README:

- A description of the problem and solution.
- The reasoning behind your technical decisions: trade-offs you might have made, anything you left out, or what you might do differently if you had additional time.
- How you would proceed and why.

### Commit History

Use whatever development workflow works best for you. If your solution is small enough and a single commit is justified, that is fine. We just ask that you keep your commit history as clean as possible.

### What We Care About

Reviewing the application we'll look at the following aspects:

- **Clarity:** Does the README clearly explain the problem and solution?
- **Correctness:** Does the submission accomplish what was asked for? If there is anything missing, does the README explain why it is missing?
- **Code quality:** Is the code simple, easy to understand, and maintainable? Is it aligned with the community-accepted way of solving similar problems?
- **Testing:** If required, what testing approach was taken? Will the tests be difficult to change if the requirements of the application changed?
- **Technical decisions:** Do choices of libraries, algorithms, and architecture seem appropriate for the challenge?
